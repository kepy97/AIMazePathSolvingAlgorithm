# Maze Path Solving Algorithm

Artificial Intelligence

The problem is an example of a Sequence maze with wildcards.  

The goal is to find a solution path for a maze, which is based on a competition created by the website mazelog.com.  Below are the instructions as given (for which no one submitted a correct solution, followed by the problem and its solution.

“Start on the "a" in the top left-hand corner and move one square at a time horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. Each square you land on must follow the sequence a, b, c, a, b, c ... and so on.

The asterisks can count as any letter you like, and you may not make a U-turn by jumping straight back in the direction you've just come from.

Find the shortest route to the "c" in the bottom right-hand corner.”

The solution is to be given as a sequence of  (44) locations, including some repeats, numbered left to right, top to bottom, ie  {1 2 8 9 10 4 3 9 10 11 5 4 10 16 17 11 10 9 8 14 13 19 20 26 32 33 34 35 29 28 22 16 10 9 8 7 13 19 25 26 27 28 29 30 36}
